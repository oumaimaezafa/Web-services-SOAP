# Web Service Development and Testing Guide
This guide outlines the steps to create a web service, deploy it, analyze its WSDL, test its operations, and create a SOAP Java client.

## 4. Testing Web Service Operations
Test the operations of the web service using a tool like SoapUI or Oxygen.

## 5. Creating a SOAP Java Client
- **Generate the Stub from the WSDL**: Generate a Stub from the WSDL to facilitate interaction with the web service.
- **Develop a SOAP Client**: Develop a Java SOAP client to access and utilize the web service's functionalities.
